Extracellular Electrophysiology
===============================

At the Allen Institute for Brain Science we collect extracellular electrophysiology (ecephys) data using Neuropixels probes. This subpackage of the AllenSDK contains
- code for accessing and working with our ecephys data
- code that we use for processing and analyzing these data in our pipelines


Python compatibility
--------------------
The code in this subpackage is guaranteed to be compatible with Python versions 3.6 and later. It is not compatible with Python 2.
